## Randy Messo

<p align="left">
I worked as an intern and now have worked as a Software Engineer for the past year and a half. During this period, i've worked as a quality assurance engineer. I may have been on the testing side of things but my love for development never ceased. At that point I took an interest and dove deep into the world of iOS development. The process of learning and working on new projects has drove my passion to get better.
