# IOS Portfolio

## Randy Messo

<p align="left">
I worked as an intern and have now worked as a software engineer for the past year and a half. During this period, I've worked as a quality assurance engineer. I may have been on the testing side of things but my love for development never ceased. At that point, I took an interest and dove deep into the world of iOS development. The process of learning and working on new projects has driven my passion to get better.

## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Randy. I graduated from The University of Houston with a computer science degree. I fell in love with coding during my senior year of high school where I would learn how to create games. I then went on to receive my degree in computer science. In my junior year, I did an internship in Software Quality Assurance Engineering, where I continued on full-time. As I worked, I began to love the industry of iOS development. I went through courses and built projects that were interesting to me to build upon my knowledge of Swift. This portfolio is a collection of some of the projects that I have built during this time.
